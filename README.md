# 🌱 Planto App
A SwiftUI-based iOS app to help users track, water, and care for their plants with reminders.

## 🧱 Architecture
The project follows the **MVVM** (Model–View–ViewModel) architecture pattern:

**Model**: Defines data and logic structure (Plant).

**ViewModel**: Manages app logic and binds data to the UI (PlantViewModel, NotificationManager).

**View**: Displays data using SwiftUI and reacts to changes.
